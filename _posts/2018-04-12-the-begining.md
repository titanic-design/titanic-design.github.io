The time is now. The place is here. Welcome to Titanic Design’s first ever blog post!

After over a year in business, we launched this blog to showcase our internal technical projects
as well as collaborations with other companies that utilize 3D printing. This blog will show
firsthand views of the technical challenges, headaches, and victories we face as we print our way
into the future.

## WHAT THE HECK IS TITANIC DESIGN?
We are a San Francisco/Bay area based 3D printing company specializing in rapid prototyping and
large scale designs. We assist in CAD design and all the troubleshooting that goes along with
