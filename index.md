tagline: Large Scale Rapid Prototyping
product1:
    title: Rapid Prototyping
    content: Featuring a wide variety of build envelopes our 3D prints literally stand above the crowd.
product2:
    title: Bridge Manufacturing
    content: Accelerate your projects and iterate faster with limited production runs
section1:
    title: Rapid Prototyping
    content: Dream bigger with build envelopes up to 1.2mx1mx0.7m. We offer the capability to produce high quality, accurate, titanic, single piece parts that simply cannot be made easily with other equipment. What can you make and fit in over a cubic meter of build volume?
section2:
    title: Bridge Manufacturing
    content: If one is good more is better. Bridge the gap between first prototype and final product allowing iteration even faster with functional fieldable prototypes. Test functional products earlier while avoiding hard tooling and reducing risk from change.
section3:
    title: Service
    content: One part or one thousand, design and order with confidence. Our knowledgeable and friendly staff offer technical analysis and printing feasibility on every part to make sure the parts you wanted are the parts you actually get. Mechanical engineers and CAD designers with Solidworks on staff to ensure we can provide solutions to meet your needs. From fit checks and show pieces to functional prototypes and production parts across industries we solve problems others can't.
